# 👋 Hey, I’m Andrei Portugal

### 🧠 Frontend Developer | UI Crafter | Design Minimalist

I’m a frontend developer with a taste for **modern, clean, and functional interfaces**.  
I turn creative ideas into **responsive, interactive, and pixel-perfect** digital experiences.

I’ve been developing for about **3 years**, blending **code and design** to make the web look as good as it feels.  
Currently exploring more in **backend & full-stack development** to build systems that don’t just look great—but work great too.
